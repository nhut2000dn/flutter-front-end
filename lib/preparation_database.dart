    '<div id="editdescription"><p>&nbsp;Earth Alone</p><p>The time was April. The university newbie left the room as soon as the lecture ended before everyone else at 2:45. He did not want anyone to recognise him as not an outsider, though no one knew him as such hence he would not have been stopped anyways; he still resolutely walked on to the hill road outside of the plaza.</p><p>There, he felt the unexpected change for the first time.</p><p>&lsquo;No one&rsquo;s around&hellip;&rsquo;</p><p>There was a huge number of people in lectures that ended at 2:45 Sure, not all of them were like Yoo Il Han Il Han, an outsider returning home, yet the complete absence of people in the plaza as well as in the hill road was strange.</p><p>&lsquo;Carnival is not on today. Was there a school event?</p><p>Even so, there was no need to feel strange. Yoo Il Han Il Han exited all invited chat groups ever since he attended his university! It was not as if he left out of pressure, it was solely out of his choice!</p><p>Sensing sorrow out of vain, Yoo Il Han walked down the hill valiantly in spite of the dearth of people. He wanted to hitch a ride on a shuttle bus, but there were no vehicles to be seen.</p><p>Was there a military exercise in the university? Perhaps a school wide hide-and-seek? All kinds of thoughts came into his head but he dismissed them readily. For twenty-odd years he had never held hands with a girl, and the lack of other presences right now was nothing in comparison.</p><p>However, those musings dissipated as soon as he exited the school entrance.</p><p>&lsquo;What?&rsquo;</p><p>There was no one.</p><p>&lsquo;What the hell!&rsquo;</p><p>No one was around!</p><p>&lsquo;What&rsquo;s going on. What&rsquo;s going on!&rsquo;</p><p>In panic, Yoo Il Han repeated the same phrase inanely as he ran around. No-one. To conjure up a crazy idea like a mass picnic was impossible. The situations were too alarming to escape reality.</p><p>No one. No human to be seen!</p><p>He looked through the windows of the convenience store he often visited. The meal on a table was emitting warm vapour, the chair was pulled slightly back as if someone was sitting on it moments before. Furthermore, spoons and chopsticks were erratically thrown aside, giving them a sense of their users abruptly disappearing out of thin air.</p><p>This oddity applied for all shops. Incidentally, how about parked cars? Moving cars that were in traffic had violently collided in such a way that they lost their drivers, with some on the verge of explosions due to leaking, ablaze gasoline.</p><p>&lsquo;Damn it&rsquo;</p><p>His mind may have been in disarray, but Yoo Il Han identified the hazard and escaped to a vehicle-less street. The reverberation of explosions like the ones in films soon tickled his ears.</p><p>Wind carrying the hot air blew, and Yoo Il Han fled like he was drifting on the wind. Then he shed pointless tears.</p><p>His mind was puzzled back together at a bus station.</p><p>&lsquo;Let&rsquo;s go home&rsquo;</p><p>Maybe after he washed and ate his mother&rsquo;s meals, maybe after he slept, things would be different.</p><p>Foolish ideas again sprouted the moment the crises were over. His fantasies were broken quickly this time though .The bus was simply not arriving.</p><p>&lsquo;What the fuck. What&rsquo;s going on.&rsquo;</p><p>Yoo Il Han prided himself over his mental fortitude. From primary to high school, he overcame everything by his own effort. As a result, he was attending a quite reputable university, and he was confident to do well on his own for a foreseeable future.</p><p>The chinese character &lsquo;person&rsquo; is to symbolise two men relying on each other; he never needed such weak stuff. Yoo Il Han always believed that he was like an upright number &lsquo;1&rsquo;-someone could accomplish anything unassisted</p><p>But, this was too much to handle</p><p>&lsquo;Have I alone moved to a different world?</p><p>His situation was too out-worldly that he said something so stupid. Nothing was changing. The bus was not coming, his knees were swelling in pain due to reckless running. Growing sadder every minute, he noticed his tears falling onto the bare earth like bird-droppings.</p><p>&lsquo;Pathetic, crying over trivial matters as a university student. No, fuck it. If I don&rsquo;t cry now, over what would I ever weep? Isolation during his primary school days has made me dismal before, now the entire district is avoiding me.&rsquo;</p><p>Knowing crying wouldn&rsquo;t change anything, Yoo Il Han came back to his senses swiftly. It was feverishly hot and tiring. Home was his priority.</p><p>&lsquo;Let&rsquo;s walk&rsquo;</p><p>Despite the knowledge that no one was there to hear him speak, he shouted in hope for someone to reveal oneself. Yoo Il Han embarked on an hour-and a half journey shrouded in an added layer of disappointment to the obvious result.</p><p>Of course, his mother wasn&rsquo;t present. He tried to check the time, yet all clocks, including those in mobile phones and computers, were stopped. Dad wasn&rsquo;t coming either, Yoo Il Han concluded following a couple of hours of waiting as he stared at the everlastingly blue sky.</p><p>The TV only showed static screens, the radio the same and the internet was not working. It was like humanity itself had vanished. Except himself, who was trapped in a stagnant time.</p><p>At least, water and gas pipes worked. He showered and cooked a package of instant noodles.</p><p>Slurp&hellip;Delicious</p><p>The taste deepened his sadness and more tears flowed down. He was drowzy now that he was full. I don&rsquo;t care for the mass disappearance, and whether or not the night was arriving, I must sleep. Possibly, something may become different as I sleep.

    '<div id="editdescription"><p>&shy; Earth Alone</p><p>A beautiful woman wearing white feather wings appeared.</p><p>(Oh, so it is here!) Her first words were rude.</p><p>&lsquo;Wh..who are you?</p><p>Yoo Il Han had to cover himself with blankets for he practised nudity as a sleeping habit. The woman stared at his folly grotesquely and then shifted her expressions.</p><p>(Hm. You can call me how you see me as.)</p><p>&lsquo;A home invader?&rsquo;</p><p>(I am God&rsquo;s messanger, an angel.)</p><p>She stared at Yoo Il Han and spoke each word stressfully to disclose her identity.</p><p>Since she emerged without any signs, Yoo Il Han had already figured out her paranormal nature, so he accepted the disclosure with little surprise. Too many strange things had happened already to be astonished again.</p><p>But he was being unreasonably indifferent to reality. Her next words proved so.</p><p>(Since I am running out of time,, I will be straightforward. You have been left behind.)</p><p>&lsquo;&hellip;.Left behind&hellip;?&rsquo;</p><p>Yoo Il Han&rsquo;s complexion showed confusion. Being left behind had always been intricately linked to his life. He was left behind by everyone in the primary school excursion, the middle school camping trip, the high school field trip and even in the university MT&hellip;</p><p>(God has recognised the arrival of &lsquo;disaster&rsquo; on Earth, which has led to all humans being sent to numerous different worlds in case of this happening. Somehow, only you have been excluded.</p><p>No way, being left behind on a scale of entire humanity! Consciousness dwindled. Holding onto his fading mind, Yoo Il Han questioned the angel.</p><p>&lsquo;What is the disaster&rsquo;</p><p>(Earth&rsquo;s experience gauge has been filled, so it is levelling up to the next stage.</p><p>He was full of desire to tackle her like when he was forced to replace Dad in a Sunday league team, but he managed to subside it. Then he asked.</p><p>&lsquo;What happens when it levels up?&rsquo;</p><p>(Energy of a higher level than that of Earth&rsquo;s is revealed. It is called mana. Also, the archival records initiate contact with Earth, hence humans are permitted read a part of the records. This is termed status.)</p><p>&lsquo;Good concise explanation&rsquo;</p><p>(I&rsquo;m good, aren&rsquo;t I?)</p><p>The angel and her huge breasts gloated at his praises. Yoo Il Han promptly continued his questions.</p><p>&lsquo;Why is there a need to send humanity to different worlds? In fantasy novels, it happens all of sudden for no apparant reason&hellip;&rsquo;</p><p>(Mana being divulged to Earth signifies the obligation to face mana-evolved animals, so-called monsters.)</p><p>He expected it as soon as &lsquo;mana&rsquo; was mentioned.</p><p>(Because animals adapt to mana better than humans, humanity will suffer a disaster and will be driven to extinction without intervention. There are dozens of doomed worlds already, therefore God has decided to move Earth&rsquo;s humanity to safe environments where they could adapt to mana.)</p><p>&lsquo;Do you mean that my humanity has been transported to mana-adjusted human worlds?&rsquo;</p><p>(Of course. Humans of other worlds will train them for a supply of a certain amount of &lsquo;status&rsquo;. Though there will be humans without capacity to do so, God cannot save them all.&rsquo; )</p><p>Indeed, it was obvious. Yoo Il Han thought he had heard enough, but he still had some doubts.</p><p>&lsquo;Can we not kill monsters with guns?Artilleries?&rsquo;</p><p>(Nuclear weapons cannot slay them)</p><p>&lsquo;So there really is necessity to strengthen humanity.&rsquo;</p><p>(Naturally. God is great and merciful)</p><p>The angel again gloated about in an arrogant expression and with her huge breasts pointing outwards. Seizing the opportunity, Yoo Il Han made the most despairing face possible and asked.</p><p>&lsquo;What about me?&rsquo;</p><p>(&hellip;) The angel had no words to say</p><p>&lsquo;What about me?</p><p>As Yoo Il Han pursued her answer, she turned her head a little and answered in a slightly lower voice.</p><p>(There was a mistake)</p><p>&lsquo;Correct it please.&rsquo;</p><p>(As all tickets have been booked out, you cannot go to other worlds.)</p><p>&lsquo;Not even standing rooms?&rsquo;</p><p>(No)</p><p>&lsquo;What kind of shitty God is this?&rsquo;</p><p>Finally, Yoo Il Han exploded. The angel, pitying the man, muttered as if to pacify him.</p><p>(There is a rejector bonus!)</p><p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t need it! Send me too!&rsquo;</p><p>(The instant the humanity was forced out, Earth&rsquo;s time has stopped. Until they return, you are not affected by the effects of time. In other words, you don&rsquo;t age. Though this includes all Earth&rsquo;s humans too&hellip;&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;Send me too!&rsquo;</p><p>(Moreover, God, who has sympathised with your lone rejection, has gifted you with status bonuses when the disaster occurs. Amazing ain&rsquo;t it?)</p><p>Details about status bonuses appeased Yoo Il Han&rsquo;s tandrum somewhat. Yoo Il Han lifted his head, faced the angel and enquired.</p><p>&lsquo;How about mana? I need to learn how to use it as well.&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;Till the upheaval occurs, it is not possible.&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;Ah, send me too! Send me too!&rsquo;</p><p>(Nope)</p><p>His racquets resumed, then Yoo Il Han firmly shook his head side to side. It was not going to happen. For God&rsquo;s sake, he was GOD!</p><p>(God has adjusted humanity&rsquo;s adaption period to be 10 years. Be cheerful and wait until then. I will supply meals.)</p><p>&lsquo;&hellip;I grow famished although time does not pass?&rsquo;</p><p>(Your cells function, but they do not age.)</p><p>&lsquo;That is a bit contradictory from time coming to a halt.&rsquo;</p><p>(Since you cannot train adapting to mana, should you not train your phisicality in the very least? Think optimistically: other humans adapt to mana at the expense of their physical enhancements resetting as soon as they return )</p><p>Yoo Il Han sighed and leered into her eyes. Was that really an encouragement? These useless assholes were responsible for his mess in the first place, now they were pretending to be charitable through some grand, superficial language. If this &lsquo;status bonus&rsquo; was not noteworthy, I am going to lose my temper, Yoo Il Han thought.</p><p>&lsquo;Hoooo&hellip;&rsquo;</p><p>Ten years. At last he could face reality. Ten years? I can live with that, surely. While his innate optimism persuaded himself, Yoo Il Han spat out his last question.</p><p>&lsquo;Why was I excluded. Why me?&rsquo;</p><p>(Your name was not discoverable by God, who was recording the list of humanity to be sent. He was astounded by your concealment.)</p><p>&lsquo;&hellip;..&rsquo;</p><p>And so, Yoo Il Han&rsquo;s Earth life alone had begun.</p></div>',

    '<div id="editdescription"><p>I Live Alone (1)</p><p>As Chamber was the one to TL this there are few difference.</p><p>MC name is a bit different, the &ldquo;disaster&rdquo; as my friend TLed it is called the Great Cataclysm (probably use that one after this chapter)</p><p>That&rsquo;s all enjoy reading:)</p><p>After sleeping as much as he needed, when he woke up and came to the kitchen, the meal (breakfast by feeling) prepared by the angel was producing steam on the table.</p><p>The angel herself wasn&rsquo;t there, but he wasn&rsquo;t surprised since she said that meeting her at all was a strange thing in itself and there won&rsquo;t be many times to meet her in the future.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s delicious.&rdquo;</p><p>Now that he became alone, he was touched at something very trivial. Moreover, it wasn&rsquo;t empty words when he said it was delicous. He felt sorry but it was definitely more delicious than his mother&rsquo;s food. The meal was nutritiously balanced and at the same time tasty, so it was a perfect meal.</p><p>&ldquo;And if she earns a lot of money, then she&rsquo;ll be number one wife material.&rdquo;</p><p>Who married angels? Other angels, as expected, right? &ndash; While thinking trivial things like that, when he was about to wash the dishes, the dishes disappeared silently. It seemed that washing dishes was a service.</p><p>Yu IlHan washed up and clothed himself while feeling as if he was seduced by the angel, and when he was about to wear his socks to go to college, he remembered that there was nothing he could do there and stopped.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, then.&rdquo;</p><p>What to do now.</p><p>The answer revealed itself soon. Didn&rsquo;t the angel say to train his body? Although the cells don&rsquo;t age, they are still active, so if he trained then the result will be reflected on his body.</p><p>He honestly didn&rsquo;t like moving his body. He had no athletic ability, and he had no good memoreis in regards to things related to sports.</p><p>In his middle school athletic meet relay, the baton slipped from his hands and the baton ended up touching the PE teacher&rsquo;s wig rather than the next player. &ndash; There was one such good&hellip;. good memory!</p><p>However, to use that as an excuse like a little child and avoid training, the situation was too serious.</p><p>Won&rsquo;t monsters appear in just 10 years? I can&rsquo;t practice mana like the rest of humanity so I need to do whatever I can do to raise my strength &ndash; he thought.</p><p>&lsquo;Going to the gym, eh&hellip;&rsquo;</p><p>After deciding, Yu IlHan stood up and sighed. He decided to train his body, so it was now time to research materials on how to efficiently train.</p><p>After investing half a day to look up how to train the muscles, whisked away the lunch(by feeling) on the table and left. The district gym was open as if it was obvious, and the countless machines greeted Yu IlHan.</p><p>&ldquo;Fuu.&rdquo;</p><p>Yu IlHan, who now slightly, just slightly, had motivation sighed and approached the bike which would burn his body fat.</p><p>It was the beginning of Yu IlHan&rsquo;s body modification.</p><p>Yu IlHan went to the gym without complaining at all.</p><p>For 3 years.</p><p>[Are you really a modern person? How can you do the same thing everyday for 3 years?]</p><p>It was to the point that the angel showed up and asked him.</p><p>&ldquo;But I need to do it, though.&rdquo;</p><p>[You do.]</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m doing. It&rsquo;s not much different from studying for 3 years in high school.&rdquo;</p><p>[&hellip;&hellip;]</p><p>The angel looked at Yu IlHan as if looking at a monster.</p><p>As the angel said, he didn&rsquo;t age, but Yu IlHan&rsquo;s body, after consuming sufficient nutritions and doing exercises too much, was developed to the point that he looked like a health trainer that appeared on TVs. Well, it was quite obvious since he didn&rsquo;t study at all and trained all day.</p><p>[You aren&rsquo;t an ordinary person. Although, I knew that when you had the hiding skill which could hide you from God&rsquo;s sight.]</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t make it my fault!&rdquo;</p><p>And he went to the gym for 2 more years. The period of time the angel promised him was 10 years so he had 5 years left now. At this point, he was sick and tired of going to the gym every day.</p><p>&ldquo;I have to learn some martial arts and some weaponry right?&rdquo;</p><p>[There&rsquo;s no one to teach you though?]</p><p>Although she said that there won&rsquo;t be many meeting in the future, she showed herself quite frequently and perhaps she got used to Yu IlHan but she was not poilte with him anymore. If one didn&rsquo;t consider the feathery wings on her back, then she was just a beautiful big sister, so he didn&rsquo;t feel bad at all about her attitude</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why, but internet and electricity is still working so I will study by myself by looking at some videos on youtube or something.&rdquo;</p><p>[Well, time stopped after all.]</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to keep using that excuse right?&rdquo;</p><p>[Yeah.]</p><p>Yu IlHan stopped staring at the angel and exhaled a sigh.</p><p>&ldquo;If you recommend me one, then what would it be?&rdquo;</p><p>[Vale Tudo and spear arts. Well, I don&rsquo;t think there will be much records about training in the spear so, train the basics until you die.]</p><p>&ldquo;I said one!&rdquo;</p><p>[Isn&rsquo;t there 5 years? Just get the basics down for both.]</p><p>And what? was Vale Tudo a systematic martial art in the first place?! Yu IlHan, who was about to complain to the angel, changed his mind when he saw her serious face.</p><p>It wasn&rsquo;t like she was teasing him. She advised him with the martial arts that would actually help when the earth experienced the Great Cataclysm.</p><p>Then he had no choice. If it was the angel&rsquo;s recommendation, he had to follow. Yu IlHan muttered to himself in his heart and woke his body up.</p><p>The light body movement. His changed body made him feel the time.</p><p>At first, he was really sad and lonely, but when he lived for a while, he now got used to it. Isn&rsquo;t human adaptation ability amazing?</p><p>Eating and sleeping was solved and there was something he had to do every day. Moreover, there was an angel that chatted with him from time to time. Other than the moments he thought of his mother, and became sad, it was doable.</p><p>&lsquo;I need to endure for 5 years. Just 5 years. Let&rsquo;s endure until then.&rsquo;</p><p>With that thought, Yu IlHan sat his grown body in front of the computer. He thought that Vale Tudo and spear arts were difficult to learn just from the internet, but he had5 years. He just thought that it was possible for him to do it if it was just getting the basics down.</p><p>The first 2 years were a continuation of trial and error. He did train his body but to Yu IlHan, who hadn&rsquo;t fought with other people before, Vale Tudo was like a girlfriend to him. It only existed inside monitors.</p><p>In contrast, there was some progress in spear arts. Yu IlHan, who didn&rsquo;t know the &lsquo;m&rsquo; of martial arts, used a long wooden stick instead of a spear to repeat motions of stabbing, swinging and blocking. But when it became 1 year and 2 years, his spear had some weight. Yu Ilhan gained enlightenment.</p><p>&lsquo;Martial arts in the end is the same as studying.&rsquo;</p><p>Even something undoable would become doable when repeated a lot. That belief led him higher. It was the same for studying, training his body, and now, it was the same for spear arts.</p><p>Then wouldn&rsquo;t Vale Tudo be the same? Yu IlHan, who barely succeeded grabbing the edge of martial arts, started looking for books and videos more enthusiastically and got more absorbed in training Vale Tudo and spear arts.</p><p>When he decided that he would do it, there was some progress. In the first place, Vale Tudo was basically a practical fighting technique to kill the enemy without any rules whatsoever. While researching into other martial arts books and videos, and putting effort to learn it with his body, Yu IlHan slowly, very slowly, felt like he grabbed something.</p><p>Spear arts too &ndash; He started considering the body movement that rather than just stabbing and swinging.</p><p>Pre-attack movement, post-attack movement. Movement to enhance attackpower. His steps improved, and his spear phases developed and his eye direction developed. It was a postive change that occurred while learning Vale Tudo.</p><p>Yu IlHan&rsquo;s muscles, which developed unilaterally, developed in a more battle-oriented way due to the martial arts training. It was to the point that when 8 years passed since he was left out, the angel was shocked after seeing him.</p><p>[You didn&rsquo;t eat some strange drug right?]</p><p>&ldquo;What are you taking my efforts as?!&rdquo;</p><p>[Such a surprising human. Or are all humans like this?]</p><p>&ldquo;Leave me alone.&rdquo;</p><p>The problem Yu IlHan had was that he had no opponents. He had to fight with others to know how much his techinques worked, what was wrong, and what should be fixed. How much longer does he have to practice on sandbags and beanbags?</p><p>On the 9th year of being left out and 4th year of training martial art, Yu IlHan thought that. It was something he could think of since he was more and more confident in his techniques. Fighting with others &ndash; If it was the him from 9 years ago, he would be scared senseless and run away. Or call the police.</p><p>[You know?]</p><p>With those words, the angel pointed to herself. Yu IlHan asked in doubt</p><p>&ldquo;You want me to hit you? Angel-noona?&rdquo;</p><p>[Even though I might look like this, I&rsquo;m an envoy of God and a higher existence. So I&rsquo;m unimaginably stronger than you think.]</p><p>&ldquo;You know what Vale Tudo is, right?&rdquo;</p><p>Vale Tudo was literally merciless practical combat. It was a combat tecnique that made one wonder if it was not about incapacitating the opponent but killing the opponent. Of course, he was only on his 4th year, but Yu IlHan knew how lethal of an effect it would have if he used it on humans.</p><p>[Fuu. It was me who told you to practice that. Don&rsquo;t worry and come at me.]</p><p>&ldquo;Is it really okay? You won&rsquo;t say otherwise later right?&rdquo;</p><p>[Of course.]</p><p>The angel smacked her uselessly large chests and assured him. Yu IlHan looked at her and after resolutely deciding his heart, he went at the angel with wide eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;Eat my fist containing the resentment of 9 year of isolation! Diiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiieeeeeeeeeee!&rdquo;</p><p>[Fuu.]</p><p>And he got beaten up badly. The angel was a star born for Vale Tudo.</p><p>[You know now? You can consider me a fighting opponent as you want. It&rsquo;s the biggest service since the birth of angels!]</p><p>&ldquo;No&hellip;&hellip;.!&rdquo;</p><p>After getting beaten up and getting bruises all over his body, Yu IlHan rejected with all his might, but unfortunately he didn&rsquo;t have the rights to refuse. It was because the angel truly wanted to help him survive after the Great Cataclysm after seeing him train seriously for 9 years.</p><p>From Yu IlHan&rsquo;s view, it wasn&rsquo;t very welcome, but even if he wanted to run away, he couldn&rsquo;t run away from that angel.</p><p>Fighting with the angel made his techinques truly rise rapidly. He didn&rsquo;t want to admit it, but his growth was too distinct. I want to stop feeling this pain and hit that woman no matter what it takes! &ndash; since this was his objective for moving his body.</p><p>The angel was proud and Yu IlHan was in pain. His techinques in Vale Tudo and spear arts increased.</p><p>Until the promised 10 years came.</p><p>Yu IlHan took a shower, shaved himself, and looked at his figure on the mirror. His body was strong to the point that he would be able to fight with a wolf due to training his body for 10 years, but his face was still the college freshman from 10 years ago. so there was a strange disharmony.</p><p>&ldquo;It would be good if I was a bit taller.&rdquo;</p><p>[Wouldn&rsquo;t you grow after the Great Cataclysm? Your face is a bit disappointing but your body figure is fine so if you grow a bit taller&hellip;&hellip; Hmhm. It&rsquo;ll be not half bad.]</p><p>&ldquo;What about my face!?&rdquo;</p><p>He looked at the mirror. Eyes that were not big at all, loose eyebrows, nose that wasn&rsquo;t high at all, slightly pale lips, and even more pale skin. Hmm. he couldn&rsquo;t deny that he had a slightly lifeless face.</p><p>But this was his own face. A unique face in the world.</p><p>[You engraved that much techniques into your body, so you will be able to confront low class monsters without difficulty. Then your levelling up will be smooth too. So you will be able to handle mana soon.]</p><p>The angel said. She was slightly disappointed as she was preparing for a farewell, but Yu IlHan asked back since there was something that he had a question about.</p><p>&ldquo;How can I kill those monsters? I thought you said you can&rsquo;t kill them without mana.&rdquo;</p><p>[That&rsquo;s about high class monsters made up entirely of a higher system of energy, low class monsters can be killed by guns or spears or knives easily, thoug?]</p><p>&ldquo;You decevied me angeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeellllllllllll!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Fufuu. I didn&rsquo;t lie. You just didn&rsquo;t ask for details!]</p><p>The angel proudly held out her chest and blabbed. This woman, is a naughty woman who boasted sexual appeal whenever she could &ndash; Even witha chaotic mind, Yu IlHan thought of these things.</p><p>His rage was boiling, but it calmed down after some time passed. In the end, it was a deceit for him to grow stronger. She put in effort to fill the gap of not being able to handle mana.</p><p>When he thought like that, he couldn&rsquo;t get angry so instead, all the energy left his body.</p><p>&ldquo;Ordinary college life would be impossible, right?&rdquo;</p><p>[Of course. The majority of society will be paralyzed. And a period where fighting ability rather than academic ability will be needed will come.]</p><p>&ldquo;Phew&hellip;&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>[When a dropout appeared at first, I thought the skies were collapsing, but due to your effort, I didn&rsquo;t have to worry much. You worked hard until now. You will do well in the future.]</p><p>The time came. It was the same time as 10 years ago. Of course, Yu IlHan himself couldn&rsquo;t tell the time so the angel told him.</p><p>Yu IlHan purposedly moved to the same place. The grass square inside the college campus. It was a scene he hadn&rsquo;t seen for 10 years but there was no difference.</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you for everything until now, angel-noona.&rdquo;</p><p>[Wow.]</p><p>It was the first time he said thank you. The angel also didn&rsquo;t seem to think that she would receive thanks and was flustered for a bit, but in the end, she laughed and flapped her wings and came to his side.</p><p>[It was quite a fun 10 years thanks to you too.[</p><p>&ldquo;Will I be able to see you again?&rdquo;</p><p>[Well, that will depend on you.]</p><p>The angel spoke until there, and hesitated for a bit before adding another line.</p><p>[My name is Rita.]</p><p>&ldquo;Rita.&rdquo;</p><p>Yu IlHan kept muttering her name as if he didn&rsquo;t want to forget it. The angel, Rita, watched such a figure contendedly before flapping her wings again.</p><p>[I have to go. Time on Earth will resume soon, and the people will come back.]</p><p>&ldquo;Have a safe trip, Rita-noona.&rdquo;</p><p>The two bid their farewells. Rita slowly flew up to the sky and Yu IlHan tried his best to suppress his disappointment due to the farewell with Rita, and the excitement of going back to his ordinary life from 10 years ago, and closed his eyes.</p><p>Nothing happened.</p><p>&ldquo;&hellip;&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Yu IlHan opened his eyes. He could see Rita in panic in the air.</p><p>&ldquo;&hellip;&hellip;Care to explain?&rdquo;</p><p>Yu IlHan said with a quiet voice. Rita slowly came down to the ground and laughed cutely with a &lsquo;teehee&rsquo;. And blabbed.</p><p>[I think there was a mistake.]</p><p>&ldquo;Hey you crazy XXXXXXXX!&rdquo;</p><p>[Perhaps due to stopping the time or some other reason, there seems to be a slight deviation in the time axis. It&rsquo;s alright. It won&rsquo;t be much so if you endure 10 or 20 more years&hellip;&hellip;]</p><p>&ldquo;Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaargh.&rdquo;</p><p>It&rsquo;s that f*cking time again! Yu IlHan went on a rampage while rolling on the grass square. It was because he knew that he would be beaten up if he went against the angel.</p><p>Like that, Yu IlHan, who calmed down after putting grass all over his body, muttered while looking at the resentful blue sky.</p><p>&ldquo;Good. It&rsquo;s just 10 or 20 years. I will wait no problem.&rdquo;</p><p>Humans are animals of adaptation. He did well until now so he would do well in the future &ndash; The positive attitude, which was his only good trait about him, but became one of many now, persuaded himself.</p><p>However, even after 10 years and 20 years, humanity didn&rsquo;t come back.</p><p>And when 50 years passed, Yu IlHan stopped counting time</p></div>',

He had thought that he need to prepare for whatever he could since he didn&rsquo;t know when humanity would come back.</p><p>&ldquo;Vale Tudo and spearmanship are still sloppy. Actually, it&rsquo;s better for me!&rdquo;</p><p>[Such a strange human&hellip;&hellip;.!]</p><p>Even while receiving Rita&rsquo;s strage gazes, Yu IlHan immersed himself again in training. Rita provided all 3 meals for him anyway so he only needed to think about the martial arts that he needed to learn.</p><p>And like that, 5 years and 10 years passed. It was the moment after 20 years had passed since he was left out.</p><p>Now, his punches and kicks flowed with fighting spirit that can even kill a bear, much less a human, and the wooden spear he extended powerfully not only pierced the sandbag, but it shattered it. Yu IlHan himself thought that he had no talent in regards to martial arts, but growing up like this in just 15 years was amazing. Of course, it was also because Rita, who was a great fighting partner, was there for him.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m turning 40 soon. How is it? Do I look more mature?&rdquo;</p><p>[The only thing you did was punching and stabbing with the spear. Do you think you earned anything other than enlightenment in martial arts? Did you see anyone acting their age after coming out from training in the mountains?]</p><p>&ldquo;You think so too? My mom won&rsquo;t tell me I&rsquo;m pretending to be mature, right?&rdquo;</p><p>[Don&rsquo;t worry about it and keep training.]</p><p>From this point, Rita, who came once a week, came once in 3 days. It was because she was worried that Yu IlHan might go crazy after being alone in the huge prison known as Earth for no less than 20 years.</p><p>Whether it was due to her worry and interest or due to his innate personality, Yu IlHan endured well.</p><p>He endured for 20, 30 years.</p><p>[Just how much did it deviate!]</p><p>While looking at such Yu IlHan, it was instead Rita who was nervous to the point of shouting. However, Rita&rsquo;s position wasn&rsquo;t actually that high so she wasn&rsquo;t in a position to ask God directly, and she didn&rsquo;t have the rights to reverse the time axis so she could only restlessly watch Yu IlHan training his body quietly, day by day.</p><p>&ldquo;Rita.&rdquo;</p><p>One day, Yu IlHan said with a lowered voice.</p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t remember my mom&rsquo;s face.&rdquo;</p><p>[&hellip;&hellip;I&rsquo;m sorry.]</p><p>&ldquo;Even when I look at the picture, it feels unfamiliar. Was this person really my family? Wasn&rsquo;t I living here alone in the first place? Everything was my deulsion and it is a lie that Rita made in order to console me&hellip;&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>[Don&rsquo;t say such things!]</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, it was a joke. It might be good if it was actually like that though.&rdquo;</p><p>He sighed and took back the spear. It was the time after 50 years of being left behind.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fed up. I want to do something else.&rdquo;</p><p>[I&rsquo;m sorry to say this now but&hellip;&hellip; It&rsquo;s not known when the Great Cataclysm will occur. You cannot neglect your martial arts.]</p><p>&ldquo;I know.&rdquo;</p><p>Now that they had shared several tens of years together, racial matters such as being an angel or being a human didn&rsquo;t really matter. The important thing to Yu IlHan was a person to look after him and a person who would listen to him. And Rita took that place so he followed Rita. That was enough.</p><p>Yu IlHan was also the only human that Rita came into contact with for several tens of years, so she became to harbor feelings of more than just pity and compassion for the human known as Yu IlHan. Of course, she didn&rsquo;t say it out loud.</p><p>The two&rsquo;s strange relationship which occurred due to God&rsquo;s error, was progressing in a truly marvelous direction.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll read some books.&rdquo;</p><p>[That&rsquo;s a good idea.]</p><p>Martial arts would become important after the Great Cataclysm occurs, but reading helps widening one&rsquo;s reasoning and building the foundation for one&rsquo;s actions. It would help but it wouldn&rsquo;t harm.</p><p>Yu IlHan, who acted too fast that it may seem excessive after setting his mind on something, he shut himself inside the college library straight away. As he promised with Rita, he trained Vale Tudo and spearmanship for 3 hours a day, but he invested the rest of the time solely on reading.</p><p>Even the most well preserved books would change colors after several tens of years passed, but &lsquo;thanks&rsquo; to the &lsquo;stopped time&rsquo;, objects didn&rsquo;t get affected by time. It was a good thing for Yu IlHan.</p><p>His preferences leaned towards contemporary novels, but he got fed up after reading those for about 5 years and he moved onto others. While thinking that his ordinary college life might continue after the Great Cataclysm occurs, he first studied books related to his major which was management, and when he was also about to get fed up with it, he considered plural majors and read psychology or other humanities-related books.</p><p>Unlike martial arts where the progress becomes less noticeable after a certain point, reading piles up knowledge. Yu IlHan, who was now hooked to that spread his interests to other books inside the library. Common knowledge, history, geography, calssics, physics, chemistry, art &ndash; he read every single books existing in the library.</p><p>After a few years passed, the books inside the libraries were insufficient. There was no one guarding bookstores anway, so Yu IlHan started conquering the book stores within his walking range in search for books that weren&rsquo;t in the library.</p><p>However, even this had a limit. On his 67th year of being left behind (Of course, Yu Ilhan no longer counted time), he made a big decision.</p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s learn another language.&rdquo;</p><p>[Then let&rsquo;s just change locations. I can deliver your meals wherever it is.]</p><p>&ldquo;Where is that food coming from?&rdquo;</p><p>[Secret.]</p><p>While pondering whether to cross the seas or not, he moved locations to China, the closet country. While driving any car to drive until he was out of fuel, when he found a working petrol station, he would refuel, and if not, he would just change cars.</p><p>License? There was only Yu IlHan in this world so it was okay as long as the car he drove didn&rsquo;t fall off a cliff or explode after crashing.</p><p>Even while moving, he studied Chinese in his spare time. The language studies made him sick after studying even a little became doable due to reading books for several tens of years.</p><p>And the China he arrived at somehow was too wide. And there were of course, many texts.</p><p>&ldquo;Maybe it&rsquo;s a mistake to set China as the first stop.&rdquo;</p><p>Yu IlHan screamed in joy at the fact that there were so much new knowledge. Humanity will definitely come back before I get to know all the knowledge of China &ndash; at that fact, he even felt sorry for that.</p><p>However, that was his misunderstanding. Even after adventuring all of the wide lands of China, and studied every book in China, humanity still didn&rsquo;t come back. Yu IlHan no longer asked Rita how much time passed and Rita also didn&rsquo;t speak of it.</p><p>He calmly moved to another country. It was because he felt that he might go crazy if he didn&rsquo;t get new stimulation, no matter what it was.</p><p>Kazakhstan, Uzebkistan, Pakistan, India, Mongolia&hellip;&hellip; After learning every language on Asia, he read all the books, records and even internet logs of all those countries. As if he would die if he didn&rsquo;t read something, he read and read again.</p><p>Once, he forgot the iron rule of training martial arts for 3 hours a day and was close to getting beaten up by Rita.</p><p>[Are you really alright?]</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s alright. Anyway.&rdquo;</p><p>He raised his head. The last page of the last book of the 7.5 million books inside the Russian academy of sciences was revealing itself.</p><p>Even though it was 7.5 million books, there were many books that also existed in other libraries, and to Yu IlHan, who could now read any book in a short time regardless of thickness due to reading repeatedly for countless years, it wasn&rsquo;t that hard of a task.</p><p>&ldquo;As expected, I can&rsquo;t understand technical books even after reading them.&rdquo;</p><p>Yu IlHan saw through the limits of this brain. It seemed that he wasn&rsquo;t a person who was fit for sciences. He only read because there was text, and just reading the book didn&rsquo;t make him a professional in that area.</p><p>&ldquo;Now let&rsquo;s go to Europe.&rdquo;</p><p>[You&rsquo;re speaking in Russian right now, you know?]</p><p>&ldquo;Hyv&auml;&auml;!&rdquo;</p><p>[Okay, we can go to Finland.]</p><p>When he toured Europe, middle east, and even Africa, his vocabulary became rich.</p><p>It was the 216th year after he was left behind.</p><p>&ldquo;Now there&rsquo;s just Oceania and America left!&rdquo;</p><p>Yu IlHan cheered like a middle schooler who just checked that there was little summer homework left. At his unchanging tension even though he had lived for over 200 years, Rita made a bitter smile and asked back.</p><p>[You do know that you have to go by boat, right?]</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s alright. There are many boats without owners in this world!&rdquo;</p><p>[That&rsquo;s called stealing.]</p><p>The power of time was truly amazing. It had made a clueless college student in to an all powerful adventurer. Of course, there was no need to say twice since one human was given more time than a human lifespan, but Yu IlHan kept moving without rest as if he wouold die the moment he stops.</p><p>Using all the knowledge of Geography, he set the sailing distance to the minimum, and he looked for a boat which could hold out for that distance. In the countless books he read until now, there were many specialized books related to ships, so there wasn&rsquo;t any difficulty finding a sturdy and a fueled boat, and driving it.</p><p>&ldquo;Rita, humanity didn&rsquo;t die out by any chance, right?&rdquo;</p><p>[I said there was a deviation in the time axis. I was a fool for thinking it&rsquo;s just twice or three times. It seems that it&rsquo;s at least 10 times.]</p><p>&ldquo;How exciting.&rdquo;</p><p>After he finished preparing for the voyage, Yu IlHan unhesitatingly left the land he was on. As long as Oceania and America waited for him, there was no time for leisure.</p><p>And several tens of years passed again.</p><p>&ldquo;I finiiiiiiiiiiiiished!&rdquo;</p><p>[Such a nasty guy.]</p><p>While looking at Yu Ilhan who was shouting and rolling around on top of the table inside Boston Public Library, known for being one of the biggest in America, Rita muttered with a</p><p>fed up voice.</p><p>Yu IlHan finally had conquered all the available books revealed to humanity. Even though she had watched the whole process with her own eyes, it was an unbelievable achievement.</p><p>After he left the library, sat down on a bench on the street and looked at the sky blankly for a while, Yu IlHan muttered while tilting his head.</p><p>&ldquo;What do I do now?&rdquo;</p><p>[Martial Arts?]</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve done that until now too.&rdquo;</p><p>He didn&rsquo;t only read books while touring around the world. He went to various ruins which remained in some parts of the world, he found traces of martial arts and he kept revising various shortcomings in Vale Tudo and spearmanship. Training was 3 hours at the minimum and sometimes it would go over 8 hours, and 12 hours.</p><p>His fighting arts and weapon arts which transformed to the point that he couldn&rsquo;t find the original style, was developed into a practical and high level technique to the point that Rita would have a hard time fighting him without mana.</p><p>This was something that was unachievable by someone who didn&rsquo;t have talent even if that person was given countless years. Rita of course didn&rsquo;t tell this to Yu Il Han. Since he would get ahead of himself when she did!</p><p>&ldquo;Rita, other than martial arts or knowledge, is there something that might help after the Great Cataclysm occurs?&rdquo;</p><p>The question that flew towards Rita, who was thinking about Yu IlHan&rsquo;s talent, was this. When she heard this, Rita could feel goosebumps.</p><p>[You&hellip;&hellip;]</p><p>His question proved one thing.</p><p>Yu IlHan, who experienced more things than a human could experience in one life time, still didn&rsquo;t lose hope despite the time that had passed.</p><p>To him, his life wan&rsquo;t over. No, perhaps he might be thinking that it didn&rsquo;t start until now. All the things he did until now maybe just in preparation for the life after the Great Cataclysm.</p><p>It was a long time even for Rita, who was an agel, but a human who wouldn&rsquo;t live past 100 on average was treating the past years as prior preparation. Of course, he himself didn&rsquo;t know exactly how much time had passed, but that didn&rsquo;t make Rita any less surprised.</p><p>[You, how can you be like that?]</p><p>As she was dumbfounded, Rita spat out the question she endured until now.</p><p>If Yu IlHan tried to boast for a bit, he might have answered with a fancier answer, but he, who lived while looking for new knowledge and experienced without being in contact with another human for countless years, only had candidness and honesty left. It might be considered that he regressed back in to a child.</p><p>&ldquo;You said I need to do it, so I do it. I can&rsquo;t practice mana so I need to do other things.&rdquo;</p><p>[&hellip;&hellip;]</p><p>With Yu IlHan, who sighed while replying, in front of her, Rita lost her words to speak. The countless emotions and impulses mixed with each other and blew up to the point of bursting and bleached her mind pitch white.</p><p>Soon, she didn&rsquo;t know what expression to make and turned her head and spread her wings.</p><p>[I&rsquo;m going!]</p><p>&ldquo;Tell me what to do before leaving!&rdquo;</p><p>[Think about it yourself from now!]</p><p>Rita disappeared from the place, and Yu IlHan was dumbfounded. After cool-headedly judging the situation, he muttered again while sighing.</p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s first go back home.&rdquo;</p><p>This was a historic moment where an angel harbored more than just good intentions towards a human. And obviously, Yu IlHan didn&rsquo;t notice that.</p><p>Yu IlHan didn&rsquo;t know, but this was the 274th year after being left behind.</p><p>Humanity didn&rsquo;t return yet.</p><p>Author&rsquo;s notes</p><p>In fact, it&rsquo;s insufficient to read all the books in the world even with 500 years. Please think that it&rsquo;s possible only because the MC only read book for 100 years and his reading ability became abnormally high. In other words, novellic exaggeration!</p><p>Let me introduce myself. I&rsquo;m the always swooshing Toika! I will write diligently so please take care of me.</p><p>In this work, I was going to write how strong a man at the peak of lonliness can become, but now that I&rsquo;m writing, The angel falls for him in just 3 chapters. This won&rsquo;t do&hellip;&hellip;</p><p>Then I&rsquo;ll come back tomorrow! Adieu!</p></div>',
